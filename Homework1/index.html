    <p>The cartoon "The Simpsons" is full of satire, ridicules American and not only American life and political
        stereotypes
        and ideas, the American way of life, various traditions of peoples and world cultures. A lot of time in
        Simpson
        is
        devoted not only to ordinary Americans, but also to actors, stars and even politicians.
